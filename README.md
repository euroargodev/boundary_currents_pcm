Home page for the development of [Profile Classification Models (PCM)](https://pyxpcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) dedicated to the identification/classification of Argo profiles in boundary current systems of interest within the Euro-ArgoRISE project. 


## ðŸ›  Roadmap
1. Get one PCM for each boundary currents hydrography: [check progress here](https://github.com/euroargodev/boundary_currents_pcm/projects/1)
2. Get a product and real-time monitoring of BCs: [check progress here](https://github.com/euroargodev/boundary_currents_pcm/projects/2)
