# PCM analysis in Boundary Currents

[![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)

Home page for the development of Profile Classification Models (PCM) dedicated to the identification/classification of 
Argo profiles in boundary current systems of interest within the Euro-ArgoRISE project. 

## ðŸ›  Roadmap

1. Get one PCM for each boundary currents hydrography: [check progress here](https://github.com/euroargodev/boundary_currents_pcm/projects/1)
2. Get a product and real-time monitoring of BCs: [check progress here](https://github.com/euroargodev/boundary_currents_pcm/projects/2)
